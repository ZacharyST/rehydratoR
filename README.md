# easieR

This R package facilitates replication of Twitter-based research by providing a convenient function to download lists of tweets.  The user must acquire keys from Twitter on their own and provide tweet ID numbers.

## Getting Started

The package is under active development and not yet released on CRAN.  It can be installed using R's devtools and the URL of the master repository.

### Prerequisites

To install, need devtools.

Need rtweet, dplyr, and tibble.  They will be called when the user loads the package.  

### Example

Still need to write an example.
